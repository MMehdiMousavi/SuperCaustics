 **Official Repository for SuperCaustics: Real-time,  open-source simulation of transparent objects for deep learning applications**

SuperCaustics is a simulation tool made in Unreal Engine for generating massive computer vision datasets that include transparent objects.
SuperCaustics is specifically compatible with [ClearGrasp](https://github.com/Shreeyak/cleargrasp "ClearGrasp").  You can process the data you collect using the [Dataset Creator](https://github.com/MMehdiMousavi/SuperCaustics/blob/main/Dataset%20Creator.ipynb "Dataset Creator Script") into their style of data, though you dont specifically have to use that pipeline. You can also use the [Neural Networks](https://github.com/MMehdiMousavi/SuperCaustics/tree/main/Neural%20Networks "neural networks") provided in this repository.
