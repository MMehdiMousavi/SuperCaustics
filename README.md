# SuperCaustics
Caustics Enabled Real-time Simulation based on NVIDIA RTX Branch of UE4


SuperCaustics uses nVRTX branch of Unreal Engine to generate Photorealistic images of Transparent objects for use in Deep Learning. 
SC is designed to be plug-and-play user friendly. Run the application, use The supercaustics branch of [Probe](https://github.com/MMehdiMousavi/Probe "Probe, Image Resource Gatherer") to gather images, process the data using the notebook, and train your model using the data.

The images can be processed into [ClearGrasp's](https://github.com/Shreeyak/cleargrasp "ClearGrasp") style of data, and can be used after processing with their code.
