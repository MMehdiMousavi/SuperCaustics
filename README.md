# SuperCaustics
##Caustics Enabled Real-time Simulation based on NVIDIA RTX Branch of UE4
SuperCaustics uses nVRTX branch of Unreal Engine to generate Photorealistic images of Transparent objects for use in Deep Learning. 
The images will be processed into Cleargrasp's style of data, and can be used after processing with their code. 

This repo is a work in progress.
